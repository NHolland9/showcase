The app I've built is pretty self explanatory, use the date picker to choose the desired date and view the orders placed on that day, if any, and details on the customer.

I've set the default date to July 2019 as the test data is a few years old and there are a few orders in this month (10th/18th/21st/26th).

I hope it works!!
